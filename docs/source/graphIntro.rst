Graphical representation of data
--------------------------------

| Each tab of Tracker Name was designed to provide informative visuals of pathogen's genomic surveillance data at different levels and granularity applying a common layout to summarise key features of pathogenâ€™s evolution.
| In order to do so data describing SARS-CoV-2 variants, lineages or mutations are represented using collections of up to five different plots that allow to capture variations in their key evolutionary characteristics in space and time.
| Some of these plots serve a similar purpose in different Tabs, while others are more specific and used to describe proprietary aspects of variats, lineages or mutations.
| A complete list of all the plots generated by Tracker Name, organised by Tab of belonging and correlated by an exaustive description of their function and purpose, is available in the following sections of this manual.
